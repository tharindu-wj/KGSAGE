"""Shared stage-1 for the LLM (7.3) and ego-graph (7.4) evaluations.

Generate N corruptions from a trained generator on a chosen split and write ONE
rich CSV. Its consumers read it:
  - ego_from_csv.py             -> an ego graph per row (7.4)
  - format_for_llm.py           -> paste-ready triple blocks, corrupted +
                                   control (7.3)
  - gen_neighbourhood_context.py -> neighbourhood-context case blocks (7.4
                                   semantic)

The CSV column names are FROZEN. Here the corr_* prefix means CORRUPTED -- in
the trainer log, by contrast, corr-pick means "corroborated". orig_* holds the
true triple each corruption was derived from.

The CSV carries readable labels for both triples, so no consumer needs the
checkpoint again.

Run from the directory that contains `kgsage/` (pytorch env):
  python -m kgsage.cli.gen_corruptions_csv \
      --ckpt kgsage/outputs/checkpoints/archived/generator_fb15k237.pt \
      --data kgsage/data/FB15K-237 --split test --per_rel 4 --seed 7 \
      --out kgsage/outputs/eval/fb_corruptions.csv
