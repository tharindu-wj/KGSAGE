"""KGSAGE trainer: the dual-discriminator adversarial game (paper: Methodology).

The pipeline phases of the method, in this one file:

  Phase 1 — Neighbourhood Context Encoding — the RGCN context encoder is
     warmed up against a throwaway DistMult decoder on link prediction, then
     its output E' (the context_table: one context vector per entity) is
     FROZEN. Bloom membership sketches of every entity's 1-2 hop
     neighbourhood are built alongside.
  Phase 2 — Adversarial Generator Training — the candidate-scoring generator
     plays against two discriminators over the frozen E':
       the plausibility discriminator   "could this triple be real?"
                                        the generator pushes this HIGH
       the neighbourhood discriminator  "does the filler fit THIS anchor's
                                        neighbourhood?"
                                        the generator pushes this LOW
     Generator loss: -(plausibility) + alpha * relu(neighbourhood fit - margin)
     alpha is set by a PI controller so that the corroborated fraction — the
     share of the generator's picks that the training graph corroborates —
     stays at CORROBORATION_TARGET. Step 2a pretrains both discriminators;
     step 2b plays the game.
  Phase 3 — Corruption Generation lives in kgsage/corruption_generation.py —
     it replays the checkpoint saved here.

Everything learned (E', membership sketches, candidate pools, neighbour lists,
both discriminators) sees the TRAIN split only. The guarantee that emitted
corruptions are false against ALL splits comes from the masks applied at
corruption time, not from anything learned here.

The knobs you are most likely to re-tune are the module-level constants just
below. Fixed implementation details are NOT up there — each is defined right
above the code that uses it and marked `tuned constant:` (grep for that string
to list them). Only operational flags are on the CLI.

Usage (repo root, pytorch env):
  PYTHONPATH=experiments python -m kgsage.gan.train \
      --data data/FB15K-237 --out experiments/kgsage/outputs/checkpoints/run.pt \
      --epochs 8 --snapshot_every 1 [--init_context_from <ckpt> --device cpu]
