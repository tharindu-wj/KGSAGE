"""Known-dataset registry + dataset resolution.

A convenience lookup that maps a short dataset name to its directory. The
pattern to add a dataset:

    1. Drop train.txt / valid.txt / test.txt into kgsage/data/<NAME>/
       (Tab-separated:  head_string<TAB>relation_string<TAB>tail_string)

    2. (Optional) add an entry to KNOWN_DATASETS below so the short name works.

    3. Use the dataset directory with the trainer / downstream detector run, e.g.:
          python -m kgsage.gan.train --data kgsage/data/<NAME> --out <ckpt>.pt ...

Dataset FILES live in `kgsage/data/`; the code that reads them lives here in
`kgsage/preprocessing/`. The two were both called "data" before — they are
deliberately named apart now.

For one-off datasets that don't need a registry entry, pass a filesystem path
directly. `resolve_dataset()` distinguishes names from paths and returns a
unified config dict either way. Training hyperparameters are CLI flags on the
trainer, not stored here.

# PATHS ARE RELATIVE TO THE CWD, and the CWD is expected to be the directory
# that CONTAINS `kgsage/` — the same place you run `python -m kgsage.gan.train`

# path of your own; nothing here is resolved against the package directory.

# FROZEN: the registry KEYS ("fb15k237", "wn18rr", "yago45") and the paths
# below are shared verbatim with the `case` labels and DATA_DIR literals in

# `--data` explicitly and never import this module, so nothing enforces the
# agreement but this comment.
