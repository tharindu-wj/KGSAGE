"""Membership sketches (paper Phase 1: Neighbourhood Context Encoding).

Each entity gets a fixed-width bit vector — a Bloom filter — marking which
entities sit in its 1-2 hop neighbourhood. That bit vector is its membership
sketch: the generator's set-readable view of "who belongs to this entity's
world".

Why it exists: one row of the context table E' is a pooled 64-d vector, and a
pooled code provably cannot answer membership questions over neighbour sets
larger than its width (Wagstaff et al., ICML 2019). The membership sketch is
the cheap fix — an m-bit hashed indicator of the neighbour set. A linear read
of a sketch approximates set intersection, so a model conditioned on it CAN
learn corroboration signals that E' alone cannot carry.

Two practical points:
  - The load factor matters. At m=4096 the sketches saturated (median bit
    density 0.81) and became unreadable; the defaults m=8192 with the 2-hop
    set capped at 1024 keep density ~0.27 (false-positive rate ~5%).
  - A Bloom filter has false positives BY DESIGN, so a membership sketch is
    only a conditioning signal — it can suggest corroboration but never prove
    it. The hard falseness guarantee stays where it always was: the exact
    masks applied at corruption time.
