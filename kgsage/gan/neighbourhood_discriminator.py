"""The neighbourhood discriminator (paper Phase 2: Adversarial Generator
Training).

The neighbourhood discriminator answers the second question about a candidate:
"does this filler FIT the anchor's neighbourhood?" It cross-attends the
candidate's E' row against a sample of the anchor's ACTUAL neighbour rows of
E' — deliberately never a single pooled vector, because a d-dimensional pooled
code cannot represent membership over neighbour sets larger than d (Wagstaff et
al.).

Training pairs are built purely from data:

    label 1 (fits)         : (anchor, its own true_filler)
    label 0 (does not fit) : (anchor, a different anchor's true_filler for
                              the same relation)

Popular hub entities appear equally in both classes, so global popularity
carries no label signal — the only way to score well is to genuinely compare
the candidate against the neighbour set. The generator is trained to push this
score DOWN (produce fillers the anchor's neighbourhood does NOT corroborate),
while the plausibility discriminator (plausibility_discriminator.py) keeps
those fillers realistic. The two judges together are the dual-discriminator
architecture.

The direct anchor-candidate edge is excluded from the neighbour sample by the
training-data builder; otherwise "fits" could be read off trivially.
