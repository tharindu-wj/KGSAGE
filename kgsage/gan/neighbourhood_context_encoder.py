"""The RGCN context encoder (paper Phase 1: Neighbourhood Context Encoding).

INPUT  -> OUTPUT, and keep the two straight, because they are easy to confuse:

    INPUT  : `entity_embeddings`, the RGCN layer-0 features. One free-floating
             learned vector per entity, holding no graph structure at all.
    OUTPUT : the context table E'. E'[e] summarises entity e's 2-hop
             neighbourhood, so every model that conditions on it (the generator
             and both discriminators) is neighbourhood-aware by construction.

E' is NEVER called "entity embeddings" — that name belongs to the input alone.

Where this sits in the pipeline: the encoder runs ONCE, during the Phase-1 RGCN
warm-up, which trains it through a throwaway DistMult decoder (see train.py).
The finished table E' is then frozen and stored in the checkpoint; corruption
generation replays the cached table and never needs the encoder — or
torch_geometric — again. ("Warm-up" always means this Phase-1 step; the first
epochs of Phase 2 are the plausibility-only phase, not a warm-up.)

Why RGCNConv and not FastRGCNConv: both are relation-aware, but FastRGCNConv
materialises a per-edge [E, dim, dim] weight tensor — on FB15K-237 that is
~8.9 GB per layer and runs out of memory. RGCNConv loops over relations
instead, which is slower but fits. Basis decomposition (num_bases) keeps the
parameter count small.
