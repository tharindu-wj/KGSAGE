"""Phase 3 — Corruption Generation (the paper's final pipeline phase).

Loads a trained KGSAGE checkpoint and produces one corruption per input
triple. This is the public generation API of the package — a downstream
anomaly detector calls it (directly, or through its own thin bridge module)
every time it needs a batch of negatives. Everything stays in-process; no
intermediate files. PyG is never needed here: the checkpoint carries the
frozen context table E' and the membership sketches.

Vocabulary note: inside kgsage/ the emitted false triple is always a
CORRUPTION. The detector side is what re-labels it a "negative" (training) or
an "anomaly" (evaluation) — that is a deliberate seam, not two names for one
thing drifting apart. It is also why the entry point below is called
`generate_negatives` even though this package only ever says "corruption":
that name faces the detector and is frozen.

The pipeline, one corruption per real triple:

  STEP 1  Translate the caller's integer ids -> strings -> the generator's
          integer ids (the caller and the generator may number the same
          entity differently; strings are the shared language).
  STEP 2  Pick the slot to corrupt: head or tail, 50/50. The entity that
          keeps its slot is the ANCHOR; the value being replaced is the
          TRUE_FILLER. The relation slot is never corrupted — with head and
          tail fixed there is rarely a coherent alternative relation, so
          relation corruptions come out type-incoherent (confirmed in
          downstream-detector logs).
  STEP 3  Score every CANDIDATE in the relation's FULL type pool with the
          generator, conditioned on the frozen E' rows of the triple and the
          anchor's membership sketch.
  STEP 4  Mask out every candidate that must never be picked: the
          true_filler, every KNOWN-TRUE filler of the query across ALL
          splits (this is the falseness guarantee), the other_entity of the
          triple (self-loop), everything outside the relation's type pool,
          and — optionally — every candidate the anchor's neighbourhood
          corroborates (the corroboration mask, see
          corroborated_entities_mask).
  STEP 5  Choose the PICKED_CANDIDATE: argmax over the masked scores plus
          Gumbel noise, drawn from a torch.Generator seeded from the
          caller's numpy rng — reproducible per seed.
  STEP 6  Check the picked_candidate (no self-loop, not a real fact); up to
          `max_resample` redraws. If every redraw fails, the ORIGINAL triple
          is emitted as a null corruption, counted in `used_original` and
          listed in `null_indices` — a null is a real fact and callers must
          drop or replace it before training on it. There is NO hidden
          random fallback.
  STEP 7  Translate the corruption back to the caller's integer ids.
